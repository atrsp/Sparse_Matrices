# Sparse_Matrices
A College Work designed to solve basic operations with Sparse Matrices.
###### *It also works for Dense Matrices, even though it's NOT the most optimized use of memory to treat them.*

#### These images exemplify how the Linked Lists were stored:
##### This is the Sparce Matrix we'll analyze:

### Operations included:
##### 1. Insertion of values in a Matrix;
##### 2. Sum of Matrices;
##### 3. Multiplication of Matrices;
##### 4. Multiplication of Matrices (cell per cell);
##### 5. Multiplication of a Matrix per a scalar;
##### 6. Swap Lines;
##### 7. Swap Columns;
##### 8. Slice a Matrix;
##### 9. Transpose a Matrix;
##### 10. Print a Matrix in a binary file;
##### 11. Read a Matrix from a binary file (*according to this program's specifications*);
##### 12. Convolution of Matrices;
##### 13. Print Dense Matrix;
##### 14. Print Sparse Matrix;
##### 15. Sum all the cells from a Matrix.

###### *There are more functions in the code, which we're used to develop these operations.*

### This code has comments regarding:
##### - The complexity of the functions (using the O notation);
##### - Expected outputs from each main program.
